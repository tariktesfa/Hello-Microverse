## Getting Started

**The aim of the project is to master all of the tools and best practices I learned in the second day of the program. This includes:**

    - Documenting our work in a professional way
    -  Making sure that there are no linter errors
    -  Using Githubflow properly

**The project includes the following files**

    - index.html file that includes a header with the text "Hello Microverse!". 
    - style.css file that includes one class with styles for your header.
    - .gitignore file that ignores the test.md file.
    - html and css linter file that checks linting error in the codebase.
